# Contributing to the MOD Ontology

## Design Issues

Currently MOD 2.1 design issues are under discussion and therefore any contributions should be related to design issues.

If you wish to contribute to MOD 2.1 design issues, then this should be done via the [discussions]( https://github.com/FAIR-IMPACT/MOD/discussions) in GitHub. 

If you have something to contribute to a `discussion` then please add your comments to that `discussion`. 

Only start a `New discussion` if your contribution is not covered by a current `discussion`.
Include:
- A brief overview of the design issue. 
- A detailed description of the design issue, include diagrams where appropriate. Describe what it is you want to include/change, why it should be included/changed and if appropriate how you would change it.
- If this is targeted at a specific community, then provide details of how this would benefit that community.

Once the design issues are closed and we move on to the next phase of development then these guidelines will be updated.
