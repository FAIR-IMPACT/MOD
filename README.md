# MOD-Ontology
Metadata for Ontology Description and Publication Ontology

This is an OWL ontology to capture metadata information for ontologies. It is a follow-up to the [OVM2 Ontology]( http://omv2.sourceforge.net).

MOD Ontology 1.0 was published by @biswanathdutta in September 2015:
http://dcpapers.dublincore.org/pubs/article/view/3758

MOD 1.2 is described in a paper published at MTSR 2017:
http://www.lirmm.fr/~jonquet/publications/documents/Article_MTSR-2017_MOD1.2.pdf

This project is related to the work done by @jonquet and @antooland on a new ontology metadata model implemented within AgroPortal (https://github.com/agroportal): https://github.com/agroportal/documentation/tree/master/metadata

MOD was discussed within the [RDA](http://rd-alliance.org)'s [Vocabulary Services Interest Group](http://rd-alliance.org/groups/vocabulary-services-interest-group.html) at the 11th RDA Plenary in Berlin, March 2018. The presentation containing it, delivered by Barbara Magagna is online at <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BYJyZyilVaAgc3w61jlxH5DewmdyA5hp/view>.
