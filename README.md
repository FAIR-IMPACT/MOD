# MOD-Ontology
Metadata for Ontology Description and Publication Ontology

This project consists in building an OWL ontology to capture metadata information for ontologies. 

This is somehow a follow-up of http://omv2.sourceforge.net

A MOD Ontology 1.0 was published by @biswanathdutta in September 2015: 
http://dcpapers.dublincore.org/pubs/article/view/3758

MOD 1.2 is described in a paper published at MTSR 2017:
http://www.lirmm.fr/~jonquet/publications/documents/Article_MTSR-2017_MOD1.2.pdf

This project is related to the work done by @jonquet and @antooland on a new ontology metadata model implemented within AgroPortal (https://github.com/agroportal): https://github.com/agroportal/documentation/tree/master/metadata
