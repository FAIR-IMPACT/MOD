# MOD-Ontology
Metadata for Ontology Description and Publication Ontology

This project consists in building an OWL ontology to capture metadata information for ontologies. 

This is somehow a follow-up of http://omv2.sourceforge.net

A MOD Ontology 1.0 was published by @biswanathdutta in September 2015: 
http://dcpapers.dublincore.org/pubs/article/view/3758

We are currently working on MOD 1.2 which will partially include properties listed by @jonquet and @antooland implemented within AgroPortal (https://github.com/agroportal):
