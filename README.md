# MOD-Ontology
Metadata for Ontology Description and Publication Ontology

This project consists in building an OWL ontology and application profile to capture metadata information for ontologies, vocabularies or semantic resources/artefacts in general. 

MOD was conceived as an OWL ontology to capture metadata information for ontologies. It is somehow a follow-up to the [OMV2 Ontology]( http://omv2.sourceforge.net) project.
This project is connected to the work done by @jonquet and @antool on a new ontology metadata model implemented within AgroPortal (https://github.com/agroportal): https://github.com/agroportal/documentation/tree/master/metadata

MOD1.4 is considered stable (but surely improvable). We are currently working on MOD 2.0 designed as a profile of DCAT 2.

MOD is discussed within the [RDA](http://rd-alliance.org)'s [Vocabulary Services Interest Group](http://rd-alliance.org/groups/vocabulary-services-interest-group.html) and more recently within the H2020 FAIRsFAIR Task 2.2 ("FAIR semantics").

MOD2.0 alpha was presented during the 16th RDA plenary (November 2020) and H2020 FAIRsFAIR workshop (June 2021). [See presentation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kSF0XuSr9mwBk-daR6RYut_1Dzzko33v).

MOD1.4 is available on GitHub since May 2020. See [TODO file](https://github.com/sifrproject/MOD-Ontology/blob/master/mod-v1.4_todos.txt) (and history) for details.

MOD 1.2 was presented at MTSR'17:

MOD 1.0 was published by @biswanathdutta in September 2015:
