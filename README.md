# MOD Ontology
Metadata for Ontology Description and Publication Ontology

This project consists in building an OWL ontology and application profile to capture metadata information for ontologies, vocabularies or semantic resources/artefacts in general. 

MOD was conceived as an OWL ontology to capture metadata information for ontologies. It is somehow a follow-up to the [OMV2 Ontology]( http://omv2.sourceforge.net) project.
This project is connected to the work done by @jonquet and @antool on a new ontology metadata model implemented within AgroPortal (https://github.com/agroportal): https://github.com/agroportal/documentation/tree/master/metadata

MOD1.4 is considered stable (but surely improvable). We are currently working on MOD 2.0 designed as a profile of DCAT 2.

MOD is discussed within the [RDA](http://rd-alliance.org)'s [Vocabulary Services Interest Group](http://rd-alliance.org/groups/vocabulary-services-interest-group.html) and more recently within the H2020 FAIRsFAIR Task 2.2 ("FAIR semantics") and Horizon Europe FAIR-IMPACT's WP4.

## Resources

- mod.ttl - the MOD vocabulary

- profile.ttl - the profile declaration. A description of all of the items in this profile (the formal model, validating resources, documentation etc.) according to the W3C's Profiles Ontology which describes how all the parts related to one another, the roles they play (to give guidance for use, to validate data etc.) and how this profile profiles the various standards listed above.


## Versions 
MOD 3.0 - Design issues for this version are documented and discussed under the [Discussions](https://github.com/FAIR-IMPACT/MOD/discussions) section. The MOD 3.0 file is [here](https://github.com/FAIR-IMPACT/MOD/blob/main/mod.ttl). See also, [FAIR-IMPACT milestone](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10725304) and Widoco documentation for [MOD 3.0](https://fair-impact.github.io/MOD/index-en.html)

MOD 2.0 alpha was presented during the 16th RDA plenary (November 2020) and H2020 FAIRsFAIR workshop (June 2021). [See presentation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kSF0XuSr9mwBk-daR6RYut_1Dzzko33v).
