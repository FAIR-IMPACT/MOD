# MOD-Ontology
Metadata for Ontology Description and Publication Ontology

This project consists in building an OWL ontology to capture metadata information for ontologies. 

This is an OWL ontology to capture metadata information for ontologies. It is a follow-up to the [OVM2 Ontology]( http://omv2.sourceforge.net).

A MOD Ontology 1.0 was published by @biswanathdutta in September 2015: 
http://dcpapers.dublincore.org/pubs/article/view/3758

This project is related to the work done by @jonquet and @antooland on a new ontology metadata model implemented within AgroPortal (https://github.com/agroportal): https://github.com/agroportal/documentation/tree/master/metadata

MOD was discussed within the [RDA](http://rd-alliance.org)'s [Vocabulary Services Interest Group](http://rd-alliance.org/groups/vocabulary-services-interest-group.html) at the 11th RDA Plenary in Berlin, March 2018. The presentation containing it, delivered by Barbara Magagna is online at <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BYJyZyilVaAgc3w61jlxH5DewmdyA5hp/view>.
