# MOD-Ontology
Metadata for Ontology Description and Publication Ontology

This project consists in building an OWL ontology and application profile to capture metadata information for ontologies, vocabularies or semantic resources in general. 

MOD is an OWL ontology to capture metadata information for ontologies. It is a follow-up to the [OVM2 Ontology]( http://omv2.sourceforge.net) project.
This project is related to the work done by @jonquet and @antool and on a new ontology metadata model implemented within AgroPortal (https://github.com/agroportal): https://github.com/agroportal/documentation/tree/master/metadata

MOD Ontology 1.0 was published by @biswanathdutta in September 2015: 
http://dcpapers.dublincore.org/pubs/article/view/3758

MOD Ontology 1.2 was presented at MTSR'17: 
https://hal-lirmm.ccsd.cnrs.fr/lirmm-01605783

MOD was discussed within the [RDA](http://rd-alliance.org)'s [Vocabulary Services Interest Group](http://rd-alliance.org/groups/vocabulary-services-interest-group.html) at the 11th RDA Plenary in Berlin, March 2018. The presentation containing it, delivered by Barbara Magagna is online at <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BYJyZyilVaAgc3w61jlxH5DewmdyA5hp/view>.

We are currently working on MOD 1.4 (with new URIs, rich description of the properties and mappings, documentation, extended number of properties). 
We are also currenlty discussing MOD 2.0 that would be designed as a profile of DCAT.
