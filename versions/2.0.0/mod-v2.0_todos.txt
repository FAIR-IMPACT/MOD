LOG (From December 2021): 
- Create the new OWL file for MOD 2.0 (Biswanath)
- Declare MOD on w3id (Biswanath)
- Update the README file on GitHub (Clement)
- Describe MOD2.0 with itself (Clement)
- Reintegrate the MOD1.4 properties inside MOD2 (Clement)
- Rename the current ttl fle with _profile and clean it from useless content in the profile (Clement)
- Re-create another _ontology.owl file for the MOD2 ontology with classes inside but not equivalent properties (Clement)
- Changed owl:equivalentProperty by dcterms:relation because the semantics of owl/equivalentProperty is too strong (problem with when parsing with OWL-API)
